# GenAI-FraudGuard

FraudGuard is an end-to-end fraud detection and investigation system built on the PaySim dataset, combining Machine Learning, Rule-Based Scoring, and LLM-driven explanations, with an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis.

This project demonstrates how modern financial fraud systems move beyond binary flags into explainable, investigator-ready intelligence.
